Arush's Bambaclot Mixpanel module!
=========================

As with all my stuff, it can probably be better, so send me a pull request.

Features:

- Drops code into Magento in the right places. Great.
- Arranges your custom js scripts into one file for maintainability
- Loads custom scripts at the bottom of the page so it doesn't block your page loadâ€¦ this may turn out bad though, cos clicks might be unrecognised before custom scripts are loaded. Time shall tell.
- Doesn't load anything when module is turned off, no need to block module output from System > Config > Advanced (Yuck!)

- Here's the moneymaker: Your scripts are actually in a phtml file so you have access to any Magento data to drop into the js. This is awesome for custom tags, e.g. 
 
`mixpanel.identify(<?php echo Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getCustomer()-getId(); ?>);`





Background
=========

Mixpanel have released a new js library with the ability to record some pretty awesome stuff about each visitor, e.g. Magento ID, name, email address to identify each customer, a callback option to send the recorded data to your CRM, for example when someone configures options on a high priced item, you want to know about that when you speak to them on the phone. There are some pretty intense things you can do.


Your Turn
================

Like I said this stuff is really extensible, so I'd love to see what you come up with, so go ahead and contribute.
